# Dolos core

This is the core library containing the matching algorithms behind [Dolos](https://dolos.ugent.be).
It exposes a JavaScript API to integrate plagiarism detection in your applications.

This library compiles to platform-independent JavaScript and can thus be included in web environments.

**Note:** this library does not contain parsing functionality.
If you need to parse files as well, you should consider using [Dolos lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dodona/dolos-core).
