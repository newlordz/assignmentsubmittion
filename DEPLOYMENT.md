# Railway Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deploying to Railway

This guide will help you deploy your E-Assignment Submission System to Railway.

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your code
- Railway account (free tier available)
- Basic understanding of environment variables

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

Your repository should include these files:
- âœ… `app.py` - Main Flask application
- âœ… `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- âœ… `Procfile` - Railway deployment configuration
- âœ… `railway.json` - Railway-specific settings
- âœ… `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- âœ… All templates and static files

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

1. **Go to Railway**: Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up/login
2. **Connect GitHub**: Link your GitHub account to Railway
3. **Create New Project**: Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. **Select Repository**: Choose `newlordz/assignmentsubmittion`
5. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app and start building

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, go to **Variables** tab and add:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///assignment_system.db
FLASK_ENV=production
```

**Important**: 
- Generate a strong SECRET_KEY (32+ characters)
- Railway will automatically set PORT and other variables

### Step 4: Database Setup

Railway will automatically:
- Create a PostgreSQL database (recommended for production)
- Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Handle database migrations

### Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Domains**
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

### Step 6: Monitor Your Deployment

- **Logs**: View real-time logs in Railway dashboard
- **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Health Checks**: Railway automatically monitors your app

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Details

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for sessions | Yes | - |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | Yes | sqlite:///assignment_system.db |
| `FLASK_ENV` | Flask environment | No | development |
| `PORT` | Port number | No | 5000 |

### File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile              # Railway deployment command
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.json          # Railway configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ runtime.txt           # Python version
â”œâ”€â”€ static/               # CSS, JS, images
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/            # HTML templates
â””â”€â”€ instance/             # Database files
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check `requirements.txt` for correct dependencies
   - Ensure Python version in `runtime.txt` is supported

2. **App Crashes on Startup**
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify SECRET_KEY is set
   - Check logs for specific error messages

3. **Database Issues**
   - Ensure DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   - Check if database tables are created properly

4. **Static Files Not Loading**
   - Verify static folder structure
   - Check file paths in templates
